    body: "<p>Every application runs its own holochain, on its own terms, without      the need for expensive hosting overhead. Since users are the hosts, as more      agents begin using the app, more storage becomes available.</p> <p>The “DNA”      of an app comprises the first entry of an agent’s source chain. These rules      set validation requirements ensuring that the application runs securely: that      data cannot be counterfeited, tampered with, or lost. An app’s validating DHT      randomizes redundancy of public data across nodes in the shared space. When      nodes go offline, the DHT continues to maintain the data necessary for the app      to perform. And if someone changes the app rules they write themselves out of      the shared DHT into an entirely different application.</p>"
