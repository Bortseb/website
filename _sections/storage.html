    title: Holographic storage for distributed applications
    show_text: true
    body: "<p>Holochain applications are held entirely by the people who use them.      No trusted third parties. No centralized points of failure. They enable direct      communication and consent through development solutions that minimize risk,      reduce costs, and optimize for speed.</p> <p>Holochain apps use a monotonic      Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to enforce validation rules on data published from      a user's signed source chain. Each agent holds their own immutable hash chain      and backs up a sample of the apps public data as a node in the DHT. This makes      powerful and secure decentralized computing possible on devices as lightweight      as mobile phones.</p>"
